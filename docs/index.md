# Gitploy

## What is Gitploy?

GitHub provides the [deployment API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/deployments#deployments) to deploy a specific ref(branch, SHA, tag). It offers strong features to make your team (or organization) deploy fast and safely. **But it takes a lot of resources to build the deployment system around GitHub deployment API from scratch.**

Gitploy makes your team or organization **build the deployment system around GitHub in minutes.** Now, do not waste time building the deployment system.
