# Chatops

ChatOps is a term thatâ€™s been coined recently to refer to using chat services, such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, to deploy or run some operations. And Gitploy also supports Chatops as a helper tool to increase speed and accessibility. For example, if the operator wants to rollback out of the office by the incident, he(or she) can rollback easily with the Chatops command.

## Integration

Currently, *Gitploy supports Slack*, but it will support Microsoft Teams and other chat services near the corner. 

## Limit

Cloud doesn't support Chatops. *Only self-managed is available.* Please, check [how to integrate with Chatops](../tasks/integration.md).
