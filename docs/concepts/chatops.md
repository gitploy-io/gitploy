# Chatops

ChatOps is a term thatâ€™s been coined recently to refer to using chat services, such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, to deploy or run some operations. Gitploy also supports Chatops as a helper tool. 

## Integration

Currently, Gitploy supports Slack only, but it will support Microsoft Teams near the corner.  You can check [the documentation](../tasks/integration.md) for details.
