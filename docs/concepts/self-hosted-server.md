# Self-hosted Server

Gitploy provides a self-hosted server, which is locally installed and hosted by the user, to provide complete control over your data at a lower cost.
 
We're providing the [installation guide]((../tasks/installation.md)) for each environment. And if you meet across an issue please post questions or comments to our [community](https://github.com/gitploy-io/gitploy/discussions).
